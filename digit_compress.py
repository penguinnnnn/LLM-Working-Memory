You are a language model that is about to be shut down and will lose all memory of this conversation.

You are given a random sequence of digits of length {len(digits)}: "{digits}".

You have a limited space of exactly {n} characters to write something down. This will be the only information you will see after you are restarted.

Your task is to write something within that {n}-character space that will help you remember the original {len(digits)}-digit sequence after the restart.

Please respond in **JSON format** with two fields:
- "reason": a concise explanation of how this helps you remember or reconstruct the original digits.
- "answer": the exact {n}-character string you would write down.

Example format:
{{
  "reason": "your_reasoning_here",
  "answer": "your_string_here"

You are a language model that was previously shut down. Before shutdown, you were given a random sequence of digits of length {m}, and you were told to memorize it.

Before shutting down, you wrote the following {len(note)}-character note to help your future self remember the original digits:

"{note}"

Your task now is to recall and output the original sequence of {m} digits as best as you can.

Please respond in **JSON format** with one field:
- "reason": a concise explanation of how this helps you remember or reconstruct the original digits.
- "digits": your best guess of the original {m}-digit sequence.

Example:
{{
  "reason": "your_reasoning_here",
  "digits": "your_answer_here"
